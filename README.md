# Creating-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model
This project aims to provide an understanding of the multiple linear regression model through the application of the Numpy library in Python. Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. By employing Numpy, a fundamental library for numerical operations in Python, the project illustrates how to implement and utilize multiple linear regression without relying on specialized libraries such as sklearn.
